### Background & Introduction
Over the last decade, League of Legends has risen to immense popularity, consistently topping charts as the most played online game globally. This surge in player engagement has significantly expanded the ecosystem of professional League of Legends competitions, now boasting over 11 major leagues and a multitude of secondary leagues worldwide. The evolution of professional play, coupled with the escalating competitive intensity, has enhanced the game's appeal and engagement levels.  
  
Central to competitive League of Legends are the early and mid-game phases, which are pivotal in determining a team's likelihood of victory. These stages, marked by strategic movements, resource accumulation, and critical skirmishes, significantly influence the game's momentum. Metrics such as gold difference, kills, deaths, and objectives secured during these phases offer deep insights into a team's performance trajectory. Analyzing these early and mid-game metrics, therefore, provides a comprehensive snapshot of a team's strengths, weaknesses, and strategies, making them reliable indicators for predicting match outcomes in the high-stakes arena of professional League of Legends.
