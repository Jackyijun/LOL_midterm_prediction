### Background & Introduction
Over the last decade, League of Legends has risen to immense popularity, consistently topping charts as the most played online game globally. This surge in player engagement has significantly expanded the ecosystem of professional League of Legends competitions, now boasting over 11 major leagues and a multitude of secondary leagues worldwide. The evolution of professional play, coupled with the escalating competitive intensity, has enhanced the game's appeal and engagement levels.  
  
As a 5V5 MOBA game, League of Legends assigns 10 players to either the red or blue side, with each player occupying a distinct position and fulfilling specific team functions. In professional matches, a team's victory is intricately linked to its collective performance, encompassing strategy, coordination, and execution. Recognizing this, our focus is on harnessing data that reflects team-level performance in each game to develop a predictive model for victory or defeat.  
  
Central to competitive League of Legends are the early and mid-game phases, which are pivotal in determining a team's likelihood of victory. These stages, marked by strategic movements, resource accumulation, and critical skirmishes, significantly influence the game's momentum. Metrics such as gold difference, kills, deaths, and objectives secured during these phases offer deep insights into a team's performance trajectory. Early game actions set the match's pace and control, impacting resource distribution and map dominance, while mid-game performance either cements these early advantages or highlights a team's capacity for recovery
and adaptation. Analyzing these early and mid-game metrics, therefore, provides a comprehensive snapshot of a team's strengths, weaknesses, and strategies, making them reliable indicators for predicting match outcomes in the high- stakes arena of professional League of Legends.
